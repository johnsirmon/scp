especially from ICM (Incident and Case Management) systems and Azure DevOps (ADO) linkages‚Äîhere‚Äôs a breakdown of the key data types, relevant fields, and PII considerations based on internal documentation like DIR_30_60_90 Days Plan 1 and dri-icm-automation-document 2.

Key Data Sources and Structures
1. ICM (Incident and Case Management)
ICM incidents typically include:

Incident ID (e.g., 633627204)
Service Name (e.g., Azure Monitor, AMA)
Severity (e.g., Sev2, Sev3)
Status (e.g., Active, Closed)
Owner/Assignee (often includes alias or full name)
Discussion Threads (comments, updates, timestamps)
Linked Support Request (SR) or Case ID
Linked ADO Work Items (via RATIO or manual linkage)
Repair Items (e.g., bug IDs, fix status)
Customer Environment Metadata (e.g., subscription ID, workspace ID, region)
2. Azure DevOps (ADO) Work Items
When linked to ICMs, ADO work items may include:

Work Item ID (e.g., 32672506)
Title and Description
Tags (e.g., Supportability, Bug, Feature)
Discussion Comments
Linked Incidents or SRs
Assigned To (user alias or name)
State (e.g., New, Active, Resolved)
Custom Fields (e.g., TTM, TSH, TSM metrics)
üßæ Relevant Fields to Extract for Analysis
Field Type	Example Fields
Identifiers	Incident ID, SR ID, ADO Work Item ID
Metadata	Service Name, Severity, Status, Region, Workspace ID
Ownership	Owner alias, Assigned engineer, PG contact
Timestamps	Created Date, Last Updated, Time to Mitigate (TTM), Time to Support Handoff
Discussion Content	Comments, Action Items, Root Cause, Fix Plan
Linked Entities	ADO Work Items, Repair Items, Customer Subscription IDs
üîê PII and Sensitive Data to Cleanse
When parsing or sharing case data, you must remove or mask the following:

PII Category	Examples
Customer Identifiers	Subscription ID, Workspace ID, Tenant ID, IP addresses, email addresses
User Data	Usernames, aliases, full names (unless internal and approved)
Log Content	Any log lines that include customer data, file paths, or credentials
Freeform Comments	Any unstructured text that may include customer names or sensitive context
Note: Even internal aliases (e.g., johnsirmon@microsoft.com) may be considered sensitive depending on the audience and usage context.

üß† Best Practices for Data Parsing and Cleansing
Use Field-Based Extraction: Parse structured fields like Incident ID, Severity, Status, Owner, and TTM directly from JSON or XML exports.
Regex for PII Detection: Use regular expressions to detect and redact:
Email addresses: [\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+
IP addresses: \b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b
GUIDs and Subscription IDs: \b[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}\b
Normalize Discussion Threads: Extract only the action items, root cause summaries, and fix status. Avoid copying full comment threads unless scrubbed.
Tag Data Source: Always label whether the data came from ICM, ADO, or a support case system to maintain traceability.
